Here is what the program does correctly:
1. Takes a variable length list and a target number as input.
2. Uses Add, Mul, and Div operators for upto 7 times to generate the required target.
3. Displays the top-4 learned programs.
4. Attempts to utilize Add instead of Mul and Div as they are considered costlier functions.
5. Division is supported only for operands having no remainders. It is programmed such that the first operand is divided by the second operand.
6. Restricts Mul and Div operators to select 1 as any of the operands, as an Element operation can be utilized directly.


Here are the areas where it lacks:
1. It takes time to learn the programs. For a 4 length input list with 2-digit numbers, it takes around 15 minutes. It can be attributed to the fact that due to provision of both Mul and Div operators, the search space becomes huge. 
2. I couldn't find documentation or examples regarding ranking based on the depth of the program. I wanted to penalize more complex functions but was unable to.
