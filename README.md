Here is what the program does correctly:
1. Takes a variable length list and a target number as input.
2. Uses Add, Mul, and Div operators for upto 7 times to generate the required target.
3. Displays the top-4 learned programs.
4. Attempts to utilize Add instead of Mul and Div as they are considered costlier functions.
5. Division is supported only for operands having no remainders. It is programmed such that the first operand is divided by the second operand.
6. Restricts Mul and Div operators to select 1 as any of the operands, as an Element operation can be utilized instead. 
7. Supports ranking based on the depth of the program. Shorter, less complex programs are given more weightage.

NOTE : Due to the inclusion of a recursion-based ranking system, the time complexity of the program increased. It would be interesting to see how the program is calculating the feature scores and is it an optimal algorithm. Memoization and Dynamic Programming can really help reduce this time complexity if it's not already implemented.

Hence, if you are providing an input list of more than two or three integers, it is better to remove the Div operator from the grammar to constrain the search space for possible programs. This will exponentially reduce the structure search space, and throw results under thirty seconds.
